# Functions and Errors
In this Project of module 1 of course ETH + AVAX PROOF: Intermediate EVM Course by metacrafter we are going to make a smart contract which uses require(), assert() and revert() functions.
These three functions are part of error handling in solidity which is essential for a successful execution of a smart contract and save a user gas in best way as posssible through like by using revert function.


# Getting Started
Anyone can download the code from the [function_and_error.sol](https://github.com/tobiasrahul/Functions-and-errors/blob/main/function_and_error.sol) file from this repository. You can do so by just by cloning the repo or by copying the code from the .sol file. 

To run the code in your machine or system open the [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/#lang=en&optimize=false&runs=200&evmVersion=null&version=soljson-v0.8.26+commit.8a97fa7a.js) in the browser. Click on create new file on left side bar or click on start coding in the home page.

To compile the code just press ctrl + S on your keyword or click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. 

To Deploy the contract click on "Deploy & run trasactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. and click on deply button. After this open your recent tranaction and set values of the asked variables of the functions.
